title: Mooncake Rollout Data Transfer
description: Configure Mooncake Store as the rollout object-store backend in Miles.
---

Miles uses Ray's object store by default to pass rollout data from rollout workers to
trainers. Mooncake Store can replace Ray for this handoff. Both `train.py` and
`train_async.py` support the Mooncake backend, and the trainer receives the same
rollout dictionary with either backend.

Rollout-data transfer and model-weight transfer are separate settings:

- `--object-store-backend` selects the rollout object store.
- `--update-weight-transfer-mode` selects the model-weight transfer path.

## Requirements

Before starting a Miles job:

- Run the same Miles revision and Mooncake version on every Ray node and on the host
  that runs `mooncake_master`.
- Start `mooncake_master`, or provide a Mooncake HA endpoint, and make the endpoint
  reachable from every node. Miles connects as a client and does not manage the
  endpoint lifecycle.
- Use routable data-network addresses for Ray and Mooncake clients.
- Reserve enough host memory for `global_segment_size` and `local_buffer_size`.
- For RDMA, expose the RDMA device to the Miles environment, allow memory locking,
  and set the local device name on each node. Leaving it to automatic selection can
  spread host-memory transfers across every HCA and run far slower
  ([kvcache-ai/Mooncake#4322](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/issues/4322)).

This backend imports the structured-object API from `mooncake.structured_object_store`
(`FieldSchema`, `MooncakeBundleTransfer`, `export_ref`, `import_ref`), which Mooncake
provides from 0.3.12.post1 on; earlier releases ship the module without these names. The
Miles CUDA images use the Mooncake package that ships in the SGLang base image, and the
ROCm images add Mooncake's Python files from `mooncake-transfer-engine-non-cuda` (see
`docker/Dockerfile.rocm`). For a custom environment, install a Mooncake package that
matches the CUDA runtime and is compatible with the Miles revision. Follow the
[Mooncake installation guide](https://kvcache-ai.github.io/Mooncake/getting_started/build.html)
for current package names and supported platforms. See
[Versions and Images](/developer/versions) for how the images pick their Mooncake.

## Configure the backend

Choose the transfer protocol before starting Ray. TCP works on any routable data
network. RDMA also requires a local RDMA device on every node; device names may
differ between nodes.

If Ray and the Mooncake endpoint are already running, set the protocol and endpoint:

```bash
export MOONCAKE_PROTOCOL="<tcp-or-rdma>"
export MOONCAKE_MASTER_ADDR="<mooncake-master-host>:50051"

# RDMA only. Set this to the device on the current node before starting Ray.
# export MOONCAKE_DEVICE="<local-rdma-device>"
```

Then add these options to an existing Miles training command:

```bash
--object-store-backend mooncake \
--mooncake-store-init-kwargs \
  "{\"protocol\":\"${MOONCAKE_PROTOCOL}\",\"master_server_address\":\"${MOONCAKE_MASTER_ADDR}\"}"
```

Use a data-network address that every client can reach. The JSON value must remain
one shell argument. `MOONCAKE_MASTER_ADDR` above is only a shell variable for these
examples; the environment variable Miles itself falls back to is `MOONCAKE_MASTER`.

Launch scripts and the Mooncake end-to-end tests assemble both pieces with
`start_mooncake_master()` and `get_mooncake_object_store_args()` from
`miles/utils/external_utils/command_utils.py`. The walkthrough below spells them out
instead, so every setting stays visible.

## Two-node walkthrough

The example below runs three synchronous rollout and training iterations with FSDP.
It uses one eight-GPU node for rollout and one eight-GPU node for training. Set the
variables to match your cluster, then complete the following steps in order.

| Node | Address variable | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Head | `HEAD_IP` | Ray head, Mooncake master, rollout manager, rollout engines |
| Worker | `WORKER_IP` | Training actors and Mooncake Store segment |

Both nodes must use the same Python environment, Miles revision, and Mooncake
version. The model and dataset paths referenced by the job must be available to the
processes that use them.

### 1. Choose the protocol and set node addresses

On the head node, select TCP or RDMA and set its data-network address:

```bash
export HEAD_IP="<head-data-network-ip>"
export MOONCAKE_PROTOCOL="<tcp-or-rdma>"

# RDMA only. Use the device attached to HEAD_IP.
# export MOONCAKE_DEVICE="<head-rdma-device>"
```

On the worker node, select the same protocol and set both node addresses:

```bash
export HEAD_IP="<head-data-network-ip>"
export WORKER_IP="<worker-data-network-ip>"
export MOONCAKE_PROTOCOL="<tcp-or-rdma>"

# RDMA only. Use the device attached to WORKER_IP.
# export MOONCAKE_DEVICE="<worker-rdma-device>"
```

For RDMA, set `MOONCAKE_DEVICE` before starting Ray so that Ray workers inherit the
node-local device setting.

### 2. Start Mooncake and Ray on the head

Activate the Miles environment first, then run:

```bash
export MOONCAKE_LOG="${MOONCAKE_LOG:-mooncake_master.log}"

mooncake_master --rpc_port 50051 --metrics_port 50052 \
  >"${MOONCAKE_LOG}" 2>&1 &

ray stop --force
ray start --head \
  --node-ip-address "${HEAD_IP}" \
  --num-gpus 8 \
  --disable-usage-stats \
  --dashboard-host 0.0.0.0 \
  --dashboard-port 8265
```

### 3. Join the worker

Activate the same Miles environment on the worker, then run:

```bash
ray stop --force
ray start \
  --address="${HEAD_IP}:6379" \
  --node-ip-address "${WORKER_IP}" \
  --num-gpus 8 \
  --disable-usage-stats
```

Mooncake uses each Ray node IP as `local_hostname` by default. Starting Ray with the
data-network addresses above therefore keeps both systems on the same network.

### 4. Submit training from the head

Set the Store configuration and the repository, model, and dataset paths before
submitting the job. The 2 GiB values are suitable for this small example; production
jobs should size them for live rollout data, replicas, and concurrent transfers.

```bash
export MOONCAKE_MASTER_ADDR="${HEAD_IP}:50051"
export MOONCAKE_STORE_INIT_KWARGS="{\"protocol\":\"${MOONCAKE_PROTOCOL}\",\"master_server_address\":\"${MOONCAKE_MASTER_ADDR}\",\"global_segment_size\":\"2gb\",\"local_buffer_size\":\"2gb\",\"chunk_bytes\":67108864}"

export MILES_HOME="<path-to-miles>"
export MODEL_PATH="<path-to-Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct>"
export DATASET_PATH="<path-to-gsm8k-train.parquet>"
export RAY_DASHBOARD_ADDR="${RAY_DASHBOARD_ADDR:-http://127.0.0.1:8265}"

RUNTIME_ENV_JSON='{
  "env_vars": {
    "CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_CONNECTIONS": "1"
  }
}'

ray job submit --address="${RAY_DASHBOARD_ADDR}" \
  --runtime-env-json="${RUNTIME_ENV_JSON}" \
  -- python3 "${MILES_HOME}/train.py" \
  --train-backend fsdp \
  --hf-checkpoint "${MODEL_PATH}" \
  --prompt-data "${DATASET_PATH}" \
  --input-key messages \
  --label-key label \
  --apply-chat-template \
  --rollout-shuffle \
  --rm-type math \
  --num-rollout 3 \
  --rollout-batch-size 8 \
  --n-samples-per-prompt 2 \

  --advantage-estimator grpo \
  --eps-clip 0.2 \
  --optimizer adam \
  --lr 1e-6 \
  --lr-decay-style constant \
  --weight-decay 0.1 \
  --adam-beta1 0.9 \
  --adam-beta2 0.98 \
  --rollout-num-gpus 8 \
  --rollout-num-gpus-per-engine 1 \
  --num-gpus-per-node 8 \
  --sglang-mem-fraction-static 0.7 \
  --actor-num-nodes 1 \
  --actor-num-gpus-per-node 8 \
  --pin-rollout-manager-to-head \
  --update-weight-transfer-mode broadcast \
  --object-store-backend mooncake \
  --mooncake-store-init-kwargs "${MOONCAKE_STORE_INIT_KWARGS}" \
  --wandb-mode disabled
```

For fully asynchronous training, keep the same Mooncake options and use the normal
Miles async entrypoint and flags:

```diff
- python3 "${MILES_HOME}/train.py" ...
+ python3 "${MILES_HOME}/train_async.py" ...
+   --fully-async
```

See [Fully Async Rollout](/user-guide/fully-async) for the remaining async settings.

## Configuration reference

`--mooncake-store-init-kwargs` accepts the following fields:

| Field | Default source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `master_server_address` | `MOONCAKE_MASTER` | Mooncake master address or HA endpoint. |
| `local_hostname` | `MOONCAKE_LOCAL_HOSTNAME`, then Ray node IP | Data-network address advertised by this client. |
| `metadata_server` | `MOONCAKE_TE_META_DATA_SERVER`, then `P2PHANDSHAKE` | Transfer Engine metadata endpoint. |
| `protocol` | `MOONCAKE_PROTOCOL`, then `rdma` | Transfer protocol, normally `tcp` or `rdma`. |
| `device_name` | `MOONCAKE_DEVICE` | Local RDMA device. Prefer the environment variable when device names differ by node. |
| `global_segment_size` | `MOONCAKE_GLOBAL_SEGMENT_SIZE`, then `8gb` | Store capacity contributed by an eligible client. |
| `local_buffer_size` | `MOONCAKE_LOCAL_BUFFER_SIZE`, then `32gb` | Local transfer and staging capacity. |
| `chunk_bytes` | Mooncake default | Structured-object PUT chunk size. |

Values supplied in `--mooncake-store-init-kwargs` take precedence over environment
variables. Use data-network addresses in multi-node jobs; loopback addresses work
only when all clients run on one node.

Not every client contributes a segment: the rollout manager never does, and among
training actors one per node does. Size `global_segment_size` for that per-node
contribution rather than for the total client count.

Mooncake stores one replica by default. Request additional replicas with:

```bash
--mooncake-replica-num 2
```

Additional replicas require additional Store capacity.
