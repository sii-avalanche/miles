# Recipe verification levels

Every recipe is assigned one evidence level. The level applies to the exact script and
topology named in the model guide, not to the model family as a whole.

<a id="fg"></a>
## 🛡️ FG — Fully gated

- A complete training curve has been run.
- A deterministic E2E runs the canonical recipe itself at least nightly.
- Every registered metric matches the committed standard exactly.

<a id="pg"></a>
## 🧩 PG — Proxy gated

- A complete training curve has been run.
- A deterministic E2E runs a documented, scaled single-node proxy at least nightly.
- Every registered metric matches the committed standard exactly.

<a id="v"></a>
## 📈 V — Verified

A complete training curve has been run, but no deterministic E2E satisfies the FG or PG criteria above.

<a id="nv"></a>
## ○ NV — Not verified

No complete training curve has been run. Smoke tests and short debugging runs do not
count as verification.
