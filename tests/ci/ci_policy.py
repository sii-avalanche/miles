    The workflow adapter resolves trigger-specific facts into a cadence and

    test runs iff it is cadence-eligible and declares no labels (the CPU
    always-on case) or any of its labels is in the effective include set. GPU
    registrations are validated separately to require a non-empty label set.

    Broad scopes are large include sets:

    - `run-ci-all` includes every registered label.
    - Weekly and release cadences include every registered label; release
      differs from weekly only in never writing the perf baseline.
    - Nightly cadence excludes `long` and `ft-long`.
    - `run-ci-image` excludes `long`, `ft-short`, and `ft-long`.

    Branch order encodes the precedence `run-ci-all` > weekly > nightly >
    `run-ci-image`.

    Explicitly requested `run-ci-<x>` labels are unioned in last, so an
    explicit request always wins over a scope subtraction. A subtraction is
    not a per-test veto: a test carrying a subtracted label still runs when
    another of its labels is included.
