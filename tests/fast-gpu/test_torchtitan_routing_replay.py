"""The routing queues must line up with the microbatches, one entry each.

Nothing in the replay mechanism enforces that alignment: a queue serves whoever
asks next, so one unexpected forward shifts every later lookup by a microbatch.
That is not a crash and not obviously wrong in the metrics either -- adjacent
microbatches of a GRPO group share a prompt, so a shifted replay reproduces the
prompt's routing exactly and only diverges over the response.

The unexpected forward is real: a pipeline schedule infers the shapes its stages
exchange by running one forward per stage over microbatch 0, and repeats that
whenever the pass changes direction (in RL, every log-prob-then-train pair).
