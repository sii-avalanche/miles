# Pushing weights out of a pipelined trainer, which is where the stream stops
# being something every rank can complete on its own. Each stage holds only its
# own layers, so the export is rank-partial twice over -- expert parallelism
# splits a stage's experts as well -- and the transfer protocol chooses how much
# of that gets reassembled before it ships. Completing the whole model on every
# rank is what a pipelined 30B could not afford, and skipping the completion
# inside a stage is what silently corrupted expert weights, so this case exists
# to keep both halves honest. The model is the untied dense one: torchtitan
# cannot tie lm_head to the embedding across stages, so a tied checkpoint is
# refused under PP.
