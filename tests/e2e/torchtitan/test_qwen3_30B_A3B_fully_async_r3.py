# Routing replay while generation and training run at once. The rollout that
# recorded the routing is a weight version or more behind the trainer replaying
# it, which is the one thing no synchronous run can check: everything else about
# R3 was validated with the rollout and the trainer in lockstep.
#
# It also puts the disaggregated weight path under load rather than merely
# reaching it -- expert parallelism makes each rank's export partial, so
# completing the stream takes an owner broadcast, and fully_async repeats the
# whole exchange continuously instead of once per rollout.
