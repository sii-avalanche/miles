# Tensor and pipeline parallelism together, which is where the two dialects the
# backend has to speak both bite. Tensor parallelism shards the vocabulary, and
# miles' loss reduces the softmax over the tp group, so the logits have to reach
# it as the local shard -- gathering them shifts every log prob by -ln(tp).
# Pipeline parallelism infers its stage buffers once, so every microbatch of the
# run is padded to --seq-length, and the pad carries consecutive positions
# rather than zeros (thousands of one-token documents break linear attention).
# The model is the untied dense one: torchtitan cannot tie lm_head to the
# embedding across stages, so the tied 0.6B is refused under PP. It is not
# truncated, because the engine loads the whole checkpoint and the weight check
# compares every layer.
