# disk-delta is the only transfer that reconciles the weight stream against the
# checkpoint's own bytes, which makes it the one case that can catch a stream
# that is subtly wrong rather than merely slow. It has already caught three:
# fp32 master weights where the checkpoint holds bf16, a multimodal config whose
# dtype lives in text_config so the cast never applied, and a checkpoint that
# mixes dtypes per tensor -- qwen3.5 keeps its linear-attention log scales in
# fp32 beside bf16 weights. It also exercises a protocol that declines its first
# round, since that one only captures the baseline the next delta diffs against.
