"""Qwen3.5-35B-A3B: 0 MTP layers + speculative-v2 (no R3) on an FP8 TP-only rollout.

MTP training is OFF and R3 is off. The rollout still runs EAGLE spec from the
checkpoint draft, whose MTP weights are never synced from training, so this case
sets the weight-check selector to "target": only the target (main) model is
checked, skipping the draft.

The rollout is one TP4 engine without EP or DP attention, so SGLang shards every expert by
TP. It serves Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-FP8 against bf16 training, so every weight update
re-quantizes and the equality check allows quantization error.

Vision weights are also excluded (--check-weight-update-skip-list visual): miles has no
VLM/vision implementation on the training side, so they are never synced.
