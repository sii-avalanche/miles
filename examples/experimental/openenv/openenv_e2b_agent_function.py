"""E2B-sandbox variant of the OpenEnv tbench2 agent function.

A drop-in alternative to ``openenv_agent_function.run`` for
``--custom-agent-function-path``: instead of sharing one env server
(OPENENV_ENV_URL), every episode gets its OWN sandbox on an E2B-compatible
provider — built from the task's OFFICIAL image plus an env server layer,
killed when the episode ends. The provider is whatever the E2B SDK is pointed
at: E2B Cloud, or a self-hosted AgentENV deployment
(https://github.com/kvcache-ai/AgentENV) via E2B_API_URL / E2B_SANDBOX_URL.

The agent loop and training wrapper live in ``openenv_agent_function``
(sibling module) and are reused unchanged; this module only supplies its own
``run_episode`` — how an env comes into being (see the episode-wiring note
there). The image recipe lives in ``tb2_sandbox_recipe`` and its E2B
materialization in ``tb2_sandbox_e2b``; like every sandbox backend, this one
needs the pinned tbench2_env install from the README (canonical test.sh
scoring and verifier-asset withholding built into the server).

Env vars (the agent-loop ones in ``openenv_agent_function`` apply too):
  OPENENV_TB2_TASKS_DIR       path to a terminal-bench-2 checkout. Templates
                    are built once per task under a recipe-digest alias
                    (first episode of a task pays the build; repeats
                    warm-start), or pre-baked via the tb2_sandbox_e2b CLI.
  E2B_API_KEY / E2B_API_KEY_FILE   key supply on the contract every backend
                    shares (file default ~/.config/e2b/api_key; launchers
                    forward the PATH, never the value). AgentENV accepts any
                    non-empty key today.
  E2B_API_URL / E2B_SANDBOX_URL    endpoint overrides read by the SDK itself;
                    set both to target a self-hosted AgentENV.
  OPENENV_E2B_CREATE_CONCURRENCY   max in-flight sandbox creates (default 4).
  OPENENV_E2B_CREATE_MAX_RETRIES   how many throttled creates to retry (default 8).
  OPENENV_E2B_THROTTLE_PATTERNS    extra comma-separated lowercase substrings
                    classified as retryable throttling/capacity errors — a
                    self-hosted AgentENV words "at capacity" its own way, and
                    whoever deployed it can name that without a code change.

Everything describing ONE sandbox — its lifetime and the ready deadline — is
documented and read in ``tb2_sandbox_e2b``, and the per-exec timeout inside it
(TB2_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_S) in ``tb2_sandbox_recipe``, next to the code each one
steers.
