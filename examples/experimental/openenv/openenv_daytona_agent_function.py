"""Daytona-sandbox variant of the OpenEnv tbench2 agent function.

A drop-in alternative to ``openenv_agent_function.run`` for
``--custom-agent-function-path``: instead of sharing one env server
(OPENENV_ENV_URL), every episode gets its OWN Daytona cloud sandbox — built
from the task's OFFICIAL image plus an env server layer, deleted when the
episode ends. Full per-task image fidelity with zero shared infrastructure
(no Docker host, no long-lived env server) and zero cross-episode state
leakage.

The agent loop and training wrapper live in ``openenv_agent_function``
(sibling module) and are reused unchanged; this module only supplies its own
``run_episode`` — how an env comes into being (see the episode-wiring note
there). The image recipe lives in ``tb2_sandbox_recipe`` and its Daytona
materialization in ``tb2_sandbox_daytona``; the recipe bakes the installed
``tbench2_env`` package -- OpenEnv's Terminal-Bench-2 environment package --
into the image, so this variant needs the pinned tbench2_env install from
the README (canonical test.sh scoring and verifier-asset withholding built
into the server).

Env vars (the agent-loop ones in ``openenv_agent_function`` apply too):
  OPENENV_TB2_TASKS_DIR        path to a terminal-bench-2 checkout: build the
                     sandbox declaratively per episode. Daytona caches image
                     layers by definition hash, so only the first episode of a
                     task builds (~10 min); repeats start in ~1 min. No named
                     snapshots, so no org snapshot quota.
  DAYTONA_API_KEY              the Daytona API key, authenticating every
                     sandbox create/delete. Read from the worker's own
                     node-local environment; nothing forwards it. Supply it
                     via platform-injected pod env, or by exporting it in
                     the shell that starts ray on a single host.
  DAYTONA_API_KEY_FILE         fallback when DAYTONA_API_KEY is unset: path
                     of a file holding the key (default
                     ~/.config/daytona/api_key). Launchers forward this path
                     instead of the key itself, because ray runtime_env is
                     logged in plaintext. Point it at a file every node can
                     read: a dotfile, K8s Secret mount, or shared-FS path.
  OPENENV_DAYTONA_CREATE_CONCURRENCY  max in-flight sandbox creates (default 4).
  OPENENV_DAYTONA_CREATE_MAX_RETRIES  how many throttled creates to retry (default 8).

Everything describing ONE sandbox — the ready deadline, and the auto-stop /
auto-delete backstop — is documented and read in ``tb2_sandbox_daytona``, and
the per-exec timeout inside it (TB2_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_S) in
``tb2_sandbox_recipe``, next to the code each one steers.

# Each episode materializes the per-task image declaratively from the Image
# definition, read off the local TB2 checkout (OPENENV_TB2_TASKS_DIR); repeat
# creates hit Daytona's build cache, and no named snapshot is involved.
#
# The sandbox's env server is the tbench2_env baked by the recipe, installed
# per the README (at or after the huggingface/OpenEnv#1025 merge): canonical
# tests/test.sh scoring built into `evaluate`, task WORKDIR resolved
# server-side, verifier assets withheld. The launcher preflight rejects an
# older install outright, and the shared agent loop's harness-marker guard
# backstops it per episode.
#
# Creates are capped process-wide and retried with jittered backoff when Daytona
# throttles (429) or reports the org out of capacity (OPENENV_DAYTONA_CREATE_* knobs).
def _is_throttle_error(exc: BaseException) -> bool:
    """True when a sandbox create failed only because Daytona would not seat it yet.

    The SDK normalizes HTTP 429 to DaytonaRateLimitError; the text match is a
    fallback for older SDKs and server messages that only surface as text
    (e.g. "ThrottlerException: Too Many Requests").

    Quota exhaustion ("Total CPU limit exceeded. Maximum allowed: 500.", and the
    memory/disk wordings beside it) arrives as a DaytonaValidationError but is
    just as transient in a shared org: an episode aborted before its first model
    call makes check_no_aborted discard the whole group, so waiting beats failing.
