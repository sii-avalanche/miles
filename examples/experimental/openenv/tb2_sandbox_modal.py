"""Modal materialization of the per-task Terminal-Bench-2 sandbox recipe.

The recipe itself — the shell layers that turn a task's official image into a
combined task+env-server image — lives in ``tb2_sandbox_recipe`` (sibling
module) and is provider-agnostic. This module is everything Modal-specific
about turning that recipe into a running cloud sandbox:

  ``task_image(...)``   the recipe as a Modal Image: the task's official image
      pulled from its registry, then ONE LAYER PER recipe command, so an edit
      to the recipe re-runs only the layers below it instead of the whole
      chain. Layers are NOT shared between tasks — each task starts from its
      own base image, which makes every hash below it unique — so each task
      pays one cold build of the full chain (measured: ~70 s cold including
      the registry pull, ~9 s warm).
  ``create_task_sandbox(...)``  per-episode create: build-or-cache-hit the
      image, start the env server as the sandbox's entrypoint, wait for Modal's
      TCP readiness probe, expose port 8000 through an encrypted tunnel, verify
      /health, return ``(sandbox, base_url)``. The sandbox carries the recipe's
      ownership tags.

Orphan reclamation differs from the sibling providers by design. A Modal
sandbox's ``timeout`` is a hard ceiling that CANNOT be extended, so the
keepalive-thread dead-man's switch the Daytona and E2B backends use has no
counterpart here — and needs none: ``idle_timeout`` counts an open TCP
connection on a tunnel as activity, and an episode's entire I/O is exactly
that (the OpenEnv client holds a WebSocket open for the episode's lifetime).
A live episode of any length keeps its sandbox; a hard-killed caller (SIGKILL,
OOM, node loss) drops the connection and Modal reclaims the sandbox within
``idle_timeout``. ``timeout`` stays as the ceiling for the one case idleness
cannot catch: an episode that hangs while still connected.

There is deliberately no bake step: layer hashes ARE the cache key here, so
the first create for a task warms exactly what later creates hit, and nothing
a create passes could name a pre-built artifact to use instead.

Sweeping leftovers by hand needs the Python API — Modal's CLI has no
``sandbox`` subcommand. Scoping the listing to the app (``_APP_NAME``) is what
keeps a shared workspace's other workloads out of range, and the recipe's
ownership tags say which task and launcher each sandbox belongs to::

    import asyncio, modal

    async def sweep(kill=False):
        app = await modal.App.lookup.aio("openenv-tbench2", create_if_missing=True)
        async for sb in modal.Sandbox.list.aio(app_id=app.app_id):
            print(sb.object_id, await sb.get_tags.aio())
            if kill:
                await sb.terminate.aio()

    asyncio.run(sweep())

All modal imports are lazy (in-function), mirroring the sibling provider
modules: offline unit tests and non-sandbox launches must not require the SDK.
